# Bacteria population on coated and non-coated strips (2D)

In this simulation, the bacteria are allocated into different colonies. Colonies have synergistic or competitive relationships. Synergistic colonies will merge into one integrity if they overlap with each other, and competitive colonies will fight with each other until their colonies do not overlap any more. Bacteria can move, die, duplicate, eat and fight, and these actions depend on some specific properties.

## Environment

The environment of the simulation is generated with two type of strips aligned one by one. Coated strips constrain the movement of bacteria only in the current coated region. Bacteria in the non-coated strips can move to coated strips or stay in the current region. The shape of the environment is a square in this simulation, but it can be flexibly changed.
