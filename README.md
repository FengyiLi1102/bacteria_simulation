# Bacteria population on coated and non-coated strips (2D)

<div style="text-align: justify"> In this simulation, the bacteria are allocated into different colonies with a synergistic or competitive relationship in a fixed environment made of two types of materials. Bacteria can move, die, duplicate, eat and fight, and these actions depend on characterizations of the bacteria. The aim of this simulation is to find the best combination of two strips with their widths and numbers used. </div> 

## Environment

The environment of the simulation is made of two types of strips aligned one by one. 
1. **Coated strips** 
* Constrain the movement of bacteria only in the current coated region
* Have **d** as the width of the strip

2. **non-coated strips** 
* Bacteria can move to coated strips or stay in the current region. 
* Have **d2** as the width of the strip

The shape of the environment is a square in this simulation, but it can be flexibly changed by tuning the parameters.

  

## Colony

A colony is a group where bacteria live with the same relationship with others. The region of the colony is defined by the [Convex hull](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html) based on the bacteria at the outermost positions. There are two kinds of colonies:

1. **Synergistic**: Colonies merge into one integrity if their 
convex hulls overlap.

2. **Competitive**: Bacteria in the colonies fight following a way until the convex hulls do not overlap.

At the beginning of the simulation, all colonies can have a regular shape such as circle as the initial shape, and then the bacteria can be randomly generated in the colonies.

## Bacteria

Several properties are associated with the bacteria:

1. **Position**: A pair of coordinates that describes the position of the bacteria in the environment.

2. **Neighbours**: The number of neighrbours of a bacteria is equal to the number of [Voronoi cell](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html) generated by the bacteria in the same colony as it.

3. **Death_rate**: It is calculated by the equation where *DR(n)* is the death rate for a bacteria with *n* number of neighbours and *DR(0)* is the death rate when there are no neighbours.

</p>

4. **Duplicate_rate**: The rate of duplication for the bacteria and the new duplicated bacteria will be allocated at a random position close to the original one in a circle region.

5. **Move_rate**: The rate of movement for the bacteria and the bacteria will move with a pair of x and y directions based on the normal distribution.

6. **Strength**: The strength of the bacteria is defined in the following equation where *A* is the number of unit time for a bacteria to be alive, *C* is the number of colonies and *S* is the number of unit time after the bacteria took the food. The behaviour of fight between two bacteria will generate a surviour based on the strengths for each bacteria.
